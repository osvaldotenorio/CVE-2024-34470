# CVE-2024-34470

**Description:** An Unauthenticated  Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the `/public/loader.php` file. The `path` parameter does not properly filter whether the file and directory passed are part of the webroot, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

## Proof of Concept

The file /public/loader.php loads JavaScript and CSS scripts via the path parameter. However, the parameter does not filter whether the file and directory passed belong to the webroot or not, allowing any file to be read.

> Payload: `/mailinspector/public/loader.php?path=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
